#  One-Tough-Cookie
trying to dish out credit where credit is due
(Supposedly, someday it'll get the job done)
This is a general outline: please do not blindly copy/paste stuff into ur terminal. 

Constanty being rewritten; a continuous 'wip' to harden mac/osx.

In an attempt to give credit where credit is dueeee >>> :
Actual credits, initial ideas and inspiration can be found throughout github
more specifically on projects such as:

- stronghold (@alichtman)
- macOS priv & sec (@drdruh) 
- @mbynens' classic 'osx sensible defaults'
- macOS-fortress (@essandess)
- and some stuff i've managed to pickup along the way :D
